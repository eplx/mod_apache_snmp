# SECTION: Monitor Various Aspects of the Running Host
#
#   The following check up on various aspects of a host.

# proc: Check for processes that should be running.
#     proc NAME [MAX=0] [MIN=0]
#   
#     NAME:  the name of the process to check for.  It must match
#            exactly (ie, http will not find httpd processes).
#     MAX:   the maximum number allowed to be running.  Defaults to 0.
#     MIN:   the minimum number to be running.  Defaults to 0.
#   
#   The results are reported in the prTable section of the UCD-SNMP-MIB tree
#   Special Case:  When the min and max numbers are both 0, it assumes
#   you want a max of infinity and a min of 1.

# SECTION: System Information Setup
#
#   This section defines some of the information reported in
#   the "system" mib group in the mibII tree.

# syslocation: The [typically physical] location of the system.
#   Note that setting this value here means that when trying to
#   perform an snmp SET operation to the sysLocation.0 variable will make
#   the agent return the "notWritable" error code.  IE, including
#   this token in the snmpd.conf file will disable write access to
#   the variable.
#   arguments:  location_string

syslocation  home

# syscontact: The contact information for the administrator
#   Note that setting this value here means that when trying to
#   perform an snmp SET operation to the sysContact.0 variable will make
#   the agent return the "notWritable" error code.  IE, including
#   this token in the snmpd.conf file will disable write access to
#   the variable.
